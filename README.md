Generative AI tools cannot be used in this assessment task
In this assessment, you must not use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to generate any materials or content in relation to the assessment task.

Suppose you are working for a software company, and a new client who is in the Events industry wants you to develop an Android application for their company. They need an Event Management Application that will help them see the different events that they organise.

This Events management app needs to take two types of input data (Entities (Objects)) from Event Organisers:

    Event Category: What kind of an event is this?

    Event: What is the event?

Store the above two data points in a tabular format (just one record per object in Assignment 1, we will cover how to implement databases in the next assignment). 

Security: Your app should have the ability to register new event organisers (signup) and login functionalities.
